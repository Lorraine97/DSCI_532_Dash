## Usage

Target audience: Canadian environmental government administrators

Climate change has been a controversial topic when it comes to government policy making. We proivde clear evidence on the climate change trend for Canadian government administrators as well as to inform the general public, I created the dashboard to help visualize the complicated time-series climate data grouped by different regions. We will focus on temperature and precipiaion data now and allow flexible interaction with the graphs for the users to derive various conclusions, such as streaming plot of an overlay of temperaturs of different cities over the years and a comparison between the temperature trend and precipitation trend for one city.
