## Proposal 
Link: https://github.com/UBC-MDS/climadash/blob/main/report/proposal.md

## Reference
The temperature and precipitation datasets are processed datasets from the 
parent project [climadash](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/climadash/tree/main/data/processed)

- Temperature data: [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/climadash/blob/main/data/processed/temperature_data.csv)
- Precipitation data: [link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/climadash/blob/main/data/processed/percipitation_data.csv)

## Usage

Target audience: Canadian environmental government administrators

Climate change has been a controversial topic when it comes to 
government policy making. We proivde clear evidence on the climate 
change trend for Canadian government administrators as well as 
to inform the general public, I created the dashboard to help visualize 
the complicated time-series climate data grouped by different regions. 
We will focus on temperature and precipiaion data now and 
allow flexible interaction with the graphs for the users to 
derive various conclusions, such as line plot of an overlay of temperaturs of different cities over the years 
and a geographic heatmap of average temperature and precipitation for the major cities included.
